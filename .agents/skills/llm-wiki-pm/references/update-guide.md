# Update Guide

Updating is a separate discipline from ingesting. Strategy docs, competitor
positions, customer states shift. Without update discipline, the wiki
accumulates stale claims that contradict each other silently.

## When to use Update (not Ingest)

- New source contradicts an existing claim
- New info refines/corrects an existing claim
- Customer state changed (renewal, churn, expansion)
- Competitor shipped/pivoted
- Strategic bet shifted
- A decision was reversed

If the source is brand new territory (no existing pages), use Ingest instead.

## The Update Flow

### 1. Identify all affected pages

Three-way search for completeness:

```bash
# Structural, pages that link to the entity being revised
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/backlinks.py" "$WIKI" <slug>

# Semantic, paraphrases of the stale claim
# Use wiki-search semantic_search (bundled)
wiki-search semantic_search "old claim phrased in various ways"

# Exact token, numbers, codenames, specific quotes
grep -r "claim keyword" "$WIKI" --include="*.md"
```

Use all three. Backlinks catches structural references, wiki-search catches
paraphrases, grep catches literals. Miss any and you leave stale variants.

Don't update one page and leave stale variants. If the claim appears in:
- `entities/tricentis.md`
- `comparisons/test-automation-mq.md`
- `overview.md`

...all three need the update.

### 2. Show diff before writing

Present to user:

```
## Page: entities/tricentis.md
OLD:
  Pricing reported at $X per seat (source: 2025-08 analyst report).
NEW:
  Pricing reported at $Y per seat (source: raw/articles/tricentis-price-2026-03.md, 2026-03-15).

## Page: comparisons/test-automation-mq.md
OLD:
  Tricentis priced above Katalon.
NEW:
  Tricentis priced ~1.4x Katalon (from 2x per earlier note).
```

Confirm before writing. Mandatory for:
- Changes touching 5+ pages
- Changes to stated strategy or bets
- Changes contradicting prior user assertions

### 3. Cite the source in the page body

Every update lands with a citation inline or in a dated note block:

```markdown
## Pricing

As of 2026-03, ~1.4x Katalon enterprise SKU
(per [[raw/articles/tricentis-price-2026-03]]).

Previously (2025-08): 2x Katalon.
```

Don't overwrite old claims, preserve the history with dates when relevant
to understanding trends.

### 4. Stale-claim sweep

After updating the primary page, re-grep for variants:
- Phrase variations ("priced double", "2x pricing", "premium tier")
- Numeric variants ("$500", "$500/seat", "five hundred")
- Related claims that depended on the stale one

Fix all in the same pass. Don't leave landmines.

### 5. Bump dates everywhere

Every page touched → update `updated:` in frontmatter.

### 6. Handle contradictions and supersession explicitly

**Revision** (same page, refined info), stays in this Update flow. Bump
`updated:`, preserve history with dates, cite source.

**Supersession** (new page materially *replaces* old one), different flow:

```yaml
# new page frontmatter
supersedes: [old-slug]

# old page frontmatter
superseded_by: new-slug
```

Then:
- Archive old page to `_archive/`
- Run `lint.py --auto-fix` to rewrite inbound `[[old-slug]]` links
- Log: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] supersede | old-slug → new-slug`

If the new info doesn't cleanly supersede (e.g., conflicting sources, same date):

```yaml
---
title: Tricentis
contradictions: [tricentis-pricing-dispute]
---
```

Create or reference a concept page documenting the conflict. Flag in log.
Use `contradictions:` when both claims stand side-by-side.
Use `supersedes:` / `superseded_by:` when one claim replaces another.

### 7. Log unconditionally

```
## [2026-03-15] update | Tricentis pricing | source: raw/articles/tricentis-price-2026-03.md
- entities/tricentis.md
- comparisons/test-automation-mq.md
- overview.md
- Reason: new analyst report revised prior 2x claim to 1.4x
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Silent overwrite**: old claim deleted, no trace. Breaks trust.
- **Update one page, miss three**: wiki becomes internally inconsistent.
- **Uncited update**: nobody can verify 6 months later.
- **Batch update without diffs**: user can't catch over-corrections.
- **Update through Ingest flow**: loses the discipline. Use the right tool.

## Mass updates (10+ pages)

Always confirm scope first. Show the list:

```
This update will touch 14 pages:
  - entities/[12 competitor pages]
  - comparisons/test-automation-mq.md
  - overview.md

Proceed? (y/N/select subset)
```

Better to pause than to corrupt a third of the wiki in one batch.
