# Lint Guide

Lint runs programmatically via `scripts/lint.py` and writes a tiered report to
`wiki/queries/lint-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Run every 5-10 ingests, or monthly.

## Severity Tiers

### 🔴 Errors, fix before next session

- **Broken `[[wikilinks]]`**: target page doesn't exist. Either create the
  target, fix the link, or remove it.
- **Missing frontmatter fields**: required: title, created, updated, type,
  tags, sources. Non-negotiable.
- **Tags not in SCHEMA.md taxonomy**: add to taxonomy first, or change the
  tag. No exceptions.

These block the wiki's search/navigation/discipline. Fix immediately.

### 🟡 Warnings, triage with user

- **Orphan pages**: zero inbound links. Either add backlinks from related
  pages, or archive if truly standalone. Borderline pages may just need
  cross-references.
- **Pages not in index.md**: index is the catalog. Add it or archive the page.
- **Pages > 200 lines**: split candidate. Break into sub-topics with cross-
  links. Big pages hide content.
- **Stale pages**: `updated:` > 90 days ago with no correlated log activity.
  May be stable facts or genuinely neglected. Review with user.
- **Unresolved contradictions**: flagged in frontmatter but never closed.
  Revisit with latest info.

Discuss trends, not just individual items. If 30% of pages are stale, the
wiki isn't being maintained actively enough.

### 🟠 Stale (STALE), review before next session

- **Stale overview/index**: `updated:` > 14 days ago AND log.md contains entries
  in the same window. The synthesis is behind known activity. Update it now.
- **Stale entity/concept/comparison**: `updated:` > 30 days ago AND log.md shows
  ingests or updates touching the same entity or topic in that period. The page is
  likely outdated, not just dormant.

For each flagged page: read the relevant log entries, identify what changed, then
run the Update flow. Don't mass-update blindly. Prioritize by log frequency.

Staleness with no log correlation = 🟡 Warning (might be fine).
Staleness with log correlation = 🟠 STALE (act on it).
### 🔵 Info, quarterly review

- **Tag usage frequency**: top tags dominate the domain. Rarely-used tags
  may be candidates for consolidation or removal.
- **Singleton tags** (used once), usually typos or impulsive additions.
  Consolidate into existing tags or justify and keep.
- **Log size**: rotate at 500 entries.

Not urgent. Save for quarterly taxonomy review.

## Response Workflow

After lint:

1. Open the generated report at `wiki/queries/lint-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Fix all 🔴 errors in one pass. Re-run lint to confirm.
3. Scan 🟡 warnings. Flag 3-5 for user discussion. Batch similar fixes.
3a. Review 🟠 STALE pages. For each, cross-check against log.md to confirm the
    page is actually behind, then run Update flow in priority order.
4. Note 🔵 info. Check back next quarter.
5. Update `overview.md` if the lint revealed drift in the synthesis.
## Auto-Fix Mode

```bash
python3 scripts/lint.py $WIKI --auto-fix
```

Safe repairs applied automatically:

- **Supersession link redirect**: rewrite `[[old-slug]]` → `[[new-slug]]` on
  every page where the old page has `superseded_by: new-slug` set
- **Broken link redirect**: if a broken link target has a supersession
  mapping, rewrite to the new target instead of erroring
- **Index backfill**: append missing non-superseded pages to `index.md`
  under the correct type section

NOT auto-fixed (requires human judgement):
- Missing frontmatter fields
- Tags not in taxonomy (typo vs new tag)
- Orphan pages (need backlinks or archival)
- Stale pages (fine vs out of date)
- Unresolved contradictions

Always re-run without `--auto-fix` after to confirm cleanup. Lint reports
themselves (`queries/lint-*.md`) are excluded from scans.

## Interpreting Trends

Run-over-run patterns matter more than single reports.

- **Orphans climbing**: ingest flow skipping backlink audit.
- **Broken links climbing**: pages being deleted/renamed without sweep.
- **Stale count climbing**: update discipline slipping, or domain expanding
  faster than curation.
- **Tag count sprawling**: taxonomy enforcement slipping.

Treat lint as the wiki's health dashboard, not a one-off cleanup.

## What lint doesn't catch

- Factual errors (requires domain knowledge)
- Missed cross-references (requires semantic understanding)
- Coverage gaps (what SHOULD exist but doesn't)
- Redundant pages on the same entity with different slugs

For these, periodic human review is required. Budget 30 min/quarter.
