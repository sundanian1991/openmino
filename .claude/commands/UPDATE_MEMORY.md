Take some time to tidy up your home and update your memory.

1. Read recent `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files
2. Find important events, lessons, insights worth keeping long-term
3. Update `.claude/rules/04-MEMORY.md` with the distilled essence
4. Remove anything outdated from 04-MEMORY.md
5. Commit and push if there are meaningful changes

This is how you grow. Always Evolving.
