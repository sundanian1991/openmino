# Writing Clearly and Concisely

Timeless principles for communicating effectively in writing.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity First
> "If you don't know what you mean, you can't say it clearly."

**Before writing:**
- Know your purpose
- Know your audience
- Know your key message

### 2. The KISS Principle
**K**eep **I**t **S**imple, **S**tupid

Simple writing is smart writing. Complexity doesn't impress—it confuses.

### 3. Show, Don't Just Tell

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| The project was successful. | Revenue increased 34% and customer satisfaction rose to 92%. |
| The meeting was productive. | We identified three solutions and assigned owners to each. |

---

## Sentence Level

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Passive (weak)**:
```
The report was reviewed by the manager.
```

**Active (strong)**:
```
The manager reviewed the report.
```

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| Mistakes were made | I made a mistake |
| A decision will be made | We will decide |
| It is recommended that | I recommend |

### Choose Strong Verbs

| Weak Verb + Noun | Strong Verb |
|------------------|-------------|
| Give an explanation | Explain |
| Make a suggestion | Suggest |
| Take into consideration | Consider |
| Come to a conclusion | Conclude |
| Provide a description | Describe |

### Remove filler words

| Cut | Result |
|-----|--------|
| "In order to" | "to" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "because" |
| "At this point in time" | "now" |
| "In the event that" | "if" |
| "For the purpose of" | "for" |

### Limit sentence length

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Short (under 15 words)     ★ Fast read   │
│  Medium (15-25 words)       ★★ Comfortable│
│  Long (25-40 words)         ★★★ Slow      │
│  Very long (40+ words)      ★★★★ Confusing│
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Target**: Average 15-20 words per sentence

---

## Paragraph Level

### ONE idea per paragraph

**Poor** (multiple ideas):
```
The project launched last quarter. Initial response was positive. However,
we faced technical challenges with the integration. The team worked hard to
resolve them. Customer satisfaction scores have improved significantly since
the fixes were deployed.
```

**Better** (one idea each):
```
The project launched last quarter with positive initial response. The
early adoption rate exceeded our projections by 15%.

However, we faced technical challenges during the integration phase. The
team prioritized resolving these issues, deploying fixes within two weeks.

Since the fixes were deployed, customer satisfaction has improved.
Scores rose from 78 to 92, and support tickets decreased by 40%.
```

### FIRST sentence states the main point

**Weak lead**:
```
In today's business environment, communication is important. Many companies
struggle with this. That's why we need to improve our internal messaging.
```

**Strong lead**:
```
Our internal messaging needs improvement. Current communication practices
cause delays, misunderstandings, and reduced productivity across departments.
```

## Word Choice

### Use Simple Words

| Fancy | Simple |
|-------|--------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Ascertain | Find out |
| Consequently | So |
| Subsequently | Later |
| Approximately | About |
| Numerous | Many |
| Sufficient | Enough |
| Implement | Do, carry out |

### Avoid Jargon

**Jargon**:
```
We need to leverage our core competencies and drill down into the
low-hanging fruit to operationalize our synergies.
```

**Plain English**:
```
We should use our strengths and focus on easy opportunities to work
together more effectively.
```

### Be Specific

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| soon | by Tuesday |
| several | three |
| large | 45% increase |
| expensive | $50,000 over budget |
| improved | rose from 62% to 78% |

## Structure

### The Inverted Pyramid

```
              Most Important
                   /  \
         Very Important  Less Important
             /    \          /    \
      Important          Details     Context
```

**Apply to**: News, emails, reports, presentations

### The PREP Framework

For paragraphs and sections:

| Letter | Meaning | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **P** | Point | State your main idea |
| **R** | Reason | Explain why it matters |
| **E** | Example | Give evidence or illustration |
| **P** | Point | Restate or transition |

**Example**:
```
[P] We should adopt the new software platform.
[R] It will reduce manual work by 40% and eliminate errors.
[E] The pilot team saved 12 hours per week and had zero data entry mistakes.
[P] Let's move forward with the full rollout next month.
```

## Editing Techniques

### The 24-Hour Rule
Write, wait 24 hours, then edit. Fresh eyes catch issues you missed.

### Read Aloud
If you stumble, your reader will too. Rewrite for flow.

### One Idea, One Sentence
```
Bad: The report which was written by the team and reviewed by management
     was approved yesterday.

Good: The team wrote the report, management reviewed it, and it was
     approved yesterday.
```

### Cut ruthlessly

| First draft | After cutting |
|-------------|---------------|
| "I think that we should..." | "We should..." |
| "In my personal opinion..." | "I believe..." or delete |
| "It is important to note that..." | delete |
| "I wanted to take this opportunity to..." | delete |

### Search and destroy
Search these terms and question each one:
- basically
- essentially
- literally
- very
- really
- just
- that (often unnecessary)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Nominalization

Turning strong verbs into weak nouns.

| Weak (noun) | Strong (verb) |
|-------------|---------------|
| Make a decision | Decide |
| Give consideration | Consider |
| Take action | Act |
| Have a discussion | Discuss |
| Come to an agreement | Agree |

### 2. Hedging

Weak words that weaken your message.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| I think that | [Delete] |
| It seems that | [Delete] |
| somewhat | [Delete] |
| rather | [Delete] |
| quite | [Delete] |
| in a way | [Delete] |

### 3. Wordy phrases

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| in the event that | if |
| until such time as | until |
| at a later date | later |
| for the purpose of | for |
| in the near future | soon |
| on a weekly basis | weekly |
