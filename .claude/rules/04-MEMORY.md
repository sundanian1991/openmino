# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

This file is the agent's compact long-term memory. It should hold durable working principles, project indexes, and stable shared context.

Do not use this file as a transcript. Detailed project history belongs in topic files; daily raw notes belong in dated logs.

## Memory Architecture

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Core memory | `.claude/rules/04-MEMORY.md` | Compact principles, current project index, durable decisions |
| User context | `.claude/rules/03-USER.md` | Stable user preferences and context |
| Topic memory | `memory/topics/<name>.md` | Detailed project or theme history |
| Daily notes | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Raw chronological notes from recent work |

Information should flow from raw notes to topic files, then into this file only when it becomes broadly useful.

## Rules

- Store each fact in one place. Link or point to detail instead of duplicating it.
- Prefer dated, concrete memories over vague impressions.
- Remove or demote stale context during maintenance.
- Keep this file short enough to remain useful when automatically loaded.
- When the memory structure changes, update the relevant instructions and templates together.

## Current Context

- **CloudBase MCP 生图流程**（2026-07-09）：配置已完成，待新会话验证工具加载
- **guizang-material-illustration 技能**（2026-07-09）：已安装并链接，能力边界已分析
- **电视机海报项目**（2026-07-09）：J-Space 概念插图生成 + HTML 海报页面已完成

Add the current state of important projects here as short pointers. Put detailed timelines in `memory/topics/`.

## Durable Lessons

Add cross-project lessons and working principles here when they have repeated value.
